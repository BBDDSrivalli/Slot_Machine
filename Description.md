# Slot Machine Game in Python

This project is a Python-based simulation of a classic slot machine game. The player deposits money, places bets on multiple lines, spins the slot machine, and tries their luck to win big! The game features a simple interface, random symbol generation, and dynamic balance updates based on the outcomes of each spin.

## Features
- **Deposit System**: Start by depositing an initial amount to play with.
- **Line Betting**: Bet on 1 to 3 lines, with adjustable bet amounts per line.
- **Random Symbol Generation**: Spin the slot machine and watch the symbols appear in a 3x3 grid.
- **Winnings Calculation**: Automatically calculates winnings based on matching symbols across the selected lines.
- **Balance Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's balance, updating after each spin.

## How It Works
1. **Deposit**: The player inputs the amount they wish to deposit to start playing.
2. **Betting**: The player selects the number of lines to bet on and the amount to bet per line.
3. **Spinning**: The slot machine generates random symbols across the 3x3 grid.
4. **Winning/Losing**: The game checks for matching symbols across the selected lines and updates the balance based on the results.
5. **Replay or Quit**: The player can choose to spin again or quit the game.
